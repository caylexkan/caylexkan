Hi there! I’m Caylex. I’m excited about learning to code and currently diving into different programming languages. As I explore this new world, I’m always eager to discover and understand more. Feel free to call me Caylex or Kan—whichever you prefer. When I’m not coding, I enjoy spending time hanging out and relaxing. I’m looking forward to connecting with others who share similar interests and learning together. Let’s code and have fun along the way!
